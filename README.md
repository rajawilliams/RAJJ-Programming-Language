# RAJJ-Programming-Language
My programming language I made for fun. I can make a seperate version for code-golfing, but I'm too lazy.

Example:

	# test.txt
	
	########
	#
	# Cool! Comments!
	#
	########

	# Empty spaces work!!!!!

	setvalue g to /rajj/testing/test2.txt
	
	print a
	
	run g
	
	setvalue s to 10
